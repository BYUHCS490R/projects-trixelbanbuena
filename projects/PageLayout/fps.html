            <p>FPS games are my favorite type of games because they really test your reflexes and strategy at the same time. I started playing with PUBG mobile when it first came out and now I play different FPS games like CODM, Warzone, and sometimes Left 4 Dead when I want to fight zombies. The best part is playing with friends and working together as a team to win matches.</p>
            <p>What makes FPS games exciting for me is that every match feels different even if you play the same map. Sometimes you get easy lobbies and sometimes you face really skilled players that make you want to improve. I usually play at night after finishing my homework because that's when my friends are online too and we can play ranked matches together.</p>
