            <p class="mycontent">Call of Duty has been my main FPS game since I started playing CODM on my phone three years ago. Now I play both mobile and Warzone on PC depending on where I am and which friends are online. The fast gameplay and different modes like Team Deathmatch, Battle Royale, and Zombies keep me coming back every day to grind for better weapons and skins.</p>
            
            <p class="mycontent">What I really like about COD compared to other FPS games is how smooth the movement feels and how satisfying it is to get kills. My favorite loadout is the AK-47 with red dot sight for medium range fights and a shotgun for close combat. Playing ranked matches taught me to communicate better with my team and learn the best spots on each map for getting kills and staying alive.</p>
