  <h1>Meet Trixia Coleen,</h1>
  <p>
    She born in <em>Nueva Vizcaya, Philippines</em> on May 19. For a long time, I dreamt of attending a university abroad. 
    After finishing gap-year courses and studying Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering, I finally made my decision to pursue 
    <strong>Accounting</strong> and <strong>Information Technology</strong> as my majors. I also spent a semester in Pangasinan, which gave me many new friends, 
    memories, and an eye-opener to the real happenings in the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now I am a <u>junior</u> in the same majors that I mentioned and am starting to apply to different schools to get my master’s in Information Systems. 
    I enjoy analyzing plots in movies and TV shows, especially horror and thriller, doing mind breaker games like Sudoku, and sewing and customizing clothes. 
    My goal is to combine my love for problem solving and creativity to build solutions in technology and accounting that help people work smarter.
