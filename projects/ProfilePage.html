    <h1><mark>Meet Trixia Coleen,</mark></h1>
    <p>
      She born in <em>Nueva Vizcaya, Philippines</em> on May 19. For a long time, she dreamt of attending a university abroad. 
      After finishing gap-year courses and studying Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering, she finally made my decision to pursue 
      <strong>Accounting</strong> and <strong>Information Technology</strong> as her majors. She also spent a semester in Pangasinan, which gave her many new friends, 
      memories, and an eye-opener to the real happenings in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she is a <u>junior</u> in the same majors that she mentioned and she's starting to apply to different schools to get my master’s in Information Systems. 
      She enjoy analyzing plots in movies and TV shows, especially horror and thriller, doing mind breaker games like Sudoku, and sewing and customizing clothes. 
      Her goal is to combine my love for problem solving and creativity to build solutions in technology and accounting that help people work smarter.
