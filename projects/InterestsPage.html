        <p>I’ve always been drawn to things that make my brain work a little harder. 
      I enjoy <strong>brain teaser games</strong> like Sudoku and other logic puzzles. 
      Thrillers and horror movies give me the same feeling; they are like living puzzles.Every detail feels like a <em>clue</em>, and I enjoy trying to solve the mystery before the ending. Watching these stories makes me feel like I’m part of the game.
        </p>
        <p>Thrillers also remind me of my studies in <abbr title="Accounting and Information Technology">AIT</abbr>. Just like solving a puzzle, I have to search for patterns, analyze details, and find answers. I also love sewing and customizing clothes—it is my creative way of building characters. For me, <dfn>thrillers</dfn> are not just about fear; they are about focus, puzzles, and imagination.

        We use a <strong>relative link</strong> for pages that are saved in the same folder. 
        For example, this link goes to my <a href="ProfilePage.html">Profile Page</a>. 
        We use an <strong>absolute link</strong> when we need the full website address.
