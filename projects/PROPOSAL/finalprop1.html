        <h2>Grassroots by GPT</h2>

        <p><b>1. Title and Topic</b></p>
        <p>
            This website will feature Grassroots by GPT, a business created by Empower Your Dreams (EYD) participants.
            Their business helps small local companies with marketing, social media content, and basic consulting.
        </p>

        <p><b>2. Why I Chose This Topic</b></p>
        <p>
            I chose this topic because it is connected to a company seeking to join Empower Your Dreams in Winter 2026. This site will contain information about the startup business idea of three students from the BUSM department. This site will also serve as a means for businesses that will procure the student’s services to communicate with the team.
        </p>
