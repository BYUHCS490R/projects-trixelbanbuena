        When I think of someone who makes horror feel like a puzzle, I think of <strong>James Wan</strong>. 
        His films are more than just scary, they are clever, with every shadow and every sound used like a clue. 
        Watching his work is like reading <q>hidden messages</q> that only make sense at the end. 
        <span class="special">His style inspires me to take creative risks.</span>
