      When I think of someone who makes horror feel like a puzzle, I think of <strong>James Wan</strong>. His films are more than just scary, they are also clever, with every shadow and every sound used like a clue. Watching his work is like reading <q>hidden messages</q> that only make sense at the end. For me, he proves that horror doesn’t have to be flat—it can be creative, exciting, and smart.
