        <h1>CSS Selectors</h1>
        <h3>1. What is the difference between an ID and a Class?</h3>
            <p id ="celestial">Answer:</p>
            <p>You can select items in CSS by their name, by an ID, or by a class. You can also use attributes, choose items based on where they sit in the structure (like inside another element), or use special selectors like hover, first-child, or before/after to style certain parts.</p>

        <h3>2. What is the difference between an ID and a Class?</h3>
            <p id ="celestial">Answer:</p>
            <p class="bigger">An ID is unique <span class="diff">and</span>should only be used once on a page, while a class can be used on many items. IDs are more powerful in CSS, but classes are better for grouping and styling multiple elements the same way.</p>
        
        <h3>3. What is the difference between a Span and a Div?</h3>
            <p id ="celestial">Answer:</p>
            <p id="truth">A span is used for small bits of text or content within a line, while a div is used for larger blocks of content. Spans are inline, divs are block-level.</p>

        <h3>4. 4. What is the difference between a Div and Header, Main, or Footer?</h3>
            <p id ="celestial">Answer:</p>
            <p>A div is just a generic container with no special meaning. Header, main, and footer are semantic elements, which means they describe the role of the content â€” like the top section, the main content, or the bottom section of a page. They make your code more meaningful and easier to understand.</p>
        
        <h3>5. What are the different ways to select a color?</h3>
            <p id ="celestial">Answer:</p>
            <p class="crison bigger">You can use named colors like red or blue, hex codes like #ff0000, or RGB values with numbers. You can also use RGBA or HSLA if you want transparency, and HSL to set colors by hue, saturation, and lightness.</p>
