    <h1> Engagement - Git and GitHub</h1>

    <h2>How do you get help?</h2>
    <p>We can watch videos under the Lecture notes in Canvas. We can also go back to our Engagements and review what we wrote there. We can also visit the tutor lab.</p>

    <h2>What time are engagement assignments due? Can you turn them in late? What if you miss one?</h2>
    <p>Due at the end of the day until midnight. We can finish it in class, but we can work on it until midnight. If we missed one, that counts 1 of our 4 chances throughout the semester.</p>

    <h2>What time are projects due? Can you turn them in late? What if you miss one?</h2>
    <p>Due every Wednesday until 11:59 pm. We can also submit it around 5 am. We can resubmit if we missed one but that will count in our 4 chances.</p>

    <h2>Describe the tags we discussed today. Remember, you can look at the lecture notes for a video that reviews what we discussed.</h2>
    <p>The doctype HTML command tells the browser to use HTML5. The HTML tag defines the root of the page and sets the language to English. The head section stores information about the page that is not shown directly. The meta charset command sets the character encoding to UTF-8 so the page can handle many types of characters. The meta viewport command makes the page adjust properly on different screen sizes. The title command sets the page title to “GitHub Help,” which shows up on the browser tab.</p>

    <h2>Paste the link to your web page. If you don't get it working, paste your questions. See the tutors tonight for help.</h2>
