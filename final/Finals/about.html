            <h2>About Grassroots by GPT</h2>
            <p>Grassroots by GPT is a student-led marketing studio that helps local businesses show up clearly online. We turn what you already do well into simple photos, captions, and brand pieces that feel like your voice. </p>
            <p>We meet with you, listen to your goals, and walk through your shop or service. From there we outline a small plan and create starter content so your community can find and trust you online while you stay focused on running the business.</p>

            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>Our mission is to make marketing feel manageable for small business owners. You do not need a huge campaign to move forward — you need honest photos, clear words,and a plan that fits into your week.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep everything simple and understandable, even if you are not comfortable with technology.</li>
                <li>Offer thoughtful support to local businesses that are not ready for a big agency.</li>
                <li>Give students real project work so they bring fresh ideas and current skills to each client.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Who We Are</h3>
            <p>Grassroots by GPT is powered by a small group of students from Business Management and related programs.  Some focus on writing, some on visuals, and others on research and planning. For each client we build a small project team, so you always work with people who know your story.</p>
            <p>This site shows where we are starting, not the final version. As we work with more clients, we will share more examples and refine our services. What will stay the same is our approach: listen carefully, respect your time, and treat your business like it matters — because it does.</p>
