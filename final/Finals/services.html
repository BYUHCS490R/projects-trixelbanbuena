            <h3>What We Focus On</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Helping you show up online without feeling overwhelmed.</li>
                <li>Creating content that fits your actual business, not random trends.</li>
                <li>Building plans that a busy owner can keep going after we are done.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>“You run the business. We will help people see it.”</em></p>

            <h2>Services for Busy Local Owners</h2>
            <p>If you are answering messages, serving customers, and doing the work yourself, marketing is probably the first thing that gets pushed aside. Grassroots by GPT offers simple support so your business can look clear and professional online without you having to learn everything at once.</p>
            <p>We focus on a few small and practical projects at a time. You get student help with writing, visuals, and planning, while we gain real experience working with real clients.</p>
            <h3>Social Media Content</h3>
            <p>We help you stop guessing what to post and when. Together we pick one or two platforms and build a small plan you can follow.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mini content calendar:</strong> ideas for posts for about two to four weeks, based on your real products and services.</li>
                <li><strong>Captions written for you:</strong> short and clear text written in your voice.</li>
                <li><strong>Simple photo prompts:</strong> suggestions for photos you can take with your phone that still look on brand.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Brand and Visual Support</h3>
            <p>You do not need a giant brand manual to look put together online. We focus on the basics so your posts, flyers, and menus feel like they belong to the same business.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Logo touch up:</strong> light cleanup or simple ideas for a basic logo.</li>
                <li><strong>Color and font starter kit:</strong> a small set of colors and fonts you can reuse everywhere.</li>
                <li><strong>Layout examples:</strong> sample designs for flyers, menus, highlight covers, or simple posts.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Light Consulting and Strategy</h3>
            <p>Before we design or write anything, we take time to understand what you want to see change. This is not a long report, just a clear and simple plan.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quick discovery chat:</strong> we ask about your customers, goals, and current challenges.</li>
                <li><strong>Clear priorities:</strong> together we choose what matters most right now.</li>
                <li><strong>Next step guide:</strong> a short list of actions you can take over the next few weeks.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Student Friendly, Owner Friendly</h3>
            <p>Grassroots by GPT is run by students at BYU Hawaii, so we keep our promises realistic and our communication honest. We focus on small projects that can be finished within a term, with clear points to check in along the way.
            </p>
            <p>Our goal is that you leave with content, ideas, and simple tools you can reuse, not just a post or a file that sits in your email.</p>
